# NCHD-Website

This project aims to enhance the homepage of the National Commission for Human Development (NCHD) website, leveraging advanced features of HTML5 and CSS3 to improve interactivity and user experience. The redesigned homepage incorporates carousels, subscription popups, videos, interactive buttons, and an overall catchy interface.


## Project Description

National Commission for Human Development (NCHD) is a not-for-profit organization committed to transforming the lives of underprivileged individuals by improving access to basic education and healthcare. NCHD serves as the leading agency in the fight against illiteracy in 124 districts of Pakistan, enabling people to escape the confines of ignorance.

With a nationwide network of 101 Human Development Support Units situated across Pakistan and extensive hands-on experience, NCHD aims to augment the scale and scope of government efforts in providing effective social services. The organization perceives human development as a process of expanding choices, building capacities, and promoting community participation at the grassroots level. NCHD is dedicated to supporting government line departments, civil society organizations, and local communities in the sectors of education, basic healthcare, and income-generating activities at the grassroots.

The objective of this project is to create a new website for NCHD using HTML5 and CSS3. By harnessing the advanced interactivity and media support offered by HTML5, the website will facilitate the seamless addition of new functionalities.
